# 2D Geometric Transformations

This project demonstrates 2D geometric transformations (translation, rotation, scaling) using Python with Tkinter.

## Setup and Installation

1. Ensure you have Python installed (Python 3.6 or higher recommended)
2. Tkinter is included with most Python installations, but you may need to install it separately on some systems:
   - On Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install python3-tk`
   - On macOS with Homebrew: `brew install python-tk`
   - On Windows: Tkinter is included with the standard Python installer

## Running the Application

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run the application with:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## How to Use

1. **Drawing a Rectangle**:

   - Click and hold the left mouse button
   - Drag to create a rectangle
   - Release the mouse button to complete the rectangle

2. **Applying Transformations**:

   - **Translate**: Click the "Translate" button and enter the x and y displacement values
   - **Rotate**: Click the "Rotate" button and enter the rotation angle in degrees
   - **Scale**: Click the "Scale" button and enter the x and y scaling factors

3. **Reset**: Click the "Reset" button to clear the canvas and start over

## Features

- White background canvas for drawing
- Interactive rectangle drawing with mouse
- Translation transformation with user-defined parameters
- Rotation transformation with user-defined angle
- Scaling transformation with user-defined factors
- Color-coded transformations for easy visualization
